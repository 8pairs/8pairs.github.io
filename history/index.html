        <p id="par"><h3>Year Summary:</h3>Live was simple, as the pandemic started its reign and forced everyone inside. DanSki305 and SquishyIsaac find themselves on the same minecraft server and begin building their town. Their settlement Kin (meaning family; loved ones) thrives as more members find themselves building unique buildings with us. After some time, Kin moves from a small area to the other side of a river with more room for expansion. A plot is fenced off as DanSki305, SquishyIsaac, CorruptCr3eper, Lolilupine, and Moo_Moo_Cow begin building their new homes. As time passes, More members join and formulate proper bases in and outside of Kin. Notably, penguinpenguino's pyramid, CorruptCr3eper's creeper themed base, and Lolilupine's repurposed castle. After TurtleGuy17 introduces everybody to his minecraft server, a slow migration begins with everybody transfering to it, and settling down. Over the corse of 2020, his server will go through different revisions with notablle builds in the first revision, such as the Backrooms and Lolilupine's castle. Although calm, common arguments broke out between TurtleGuy17 and SquishyIsaac. The friend group quickly picked up Discord as their main way of communicating, as many users had accounts already. By the end of 2020, the only game played by the group was Minecraft and Among Us.<br><h5>TurtleGuy17  SquishyIsaac  ToastedCorgi  DanSki305  CorruptCr3eper  Lolilupine  TheMajesticOverseer  Moo_Moo_Cow  penguinpenguino  Babucci  Shlorbus PerryAlienware LostCarlo</h5></p>
